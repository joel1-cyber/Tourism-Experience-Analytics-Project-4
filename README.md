Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore and clean the data.

Regression models to predict ratings

Classification models to predict the type of traveler (Business, Family, Couples, or Friends).

A Recommendation System to suggest tourist places based on user interests.

The goal is to help travel platforms make smarter decisions and improve the user experience by using data.
